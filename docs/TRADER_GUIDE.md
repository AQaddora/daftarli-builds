## Success Stories

### "Daftarli saved my business"

*Ahmed, Grocery Store Owner, Amman*

> "Before Daftarli, I had no idea if I was making profit or loss. Papers everywhere, lost receipts, customers arguing about their accounts. Now everything is clear. I know exactly where my business stands every single day. My revenue increased 30% because I could identify which products were actually profitable."

### "I wish I found this earlier"

*Fatima, Boutique Owner, Dubai*

> "As a fashion boutique owner, inventory was my nightmare. Daftarli's barcode system and stock tracking changed everything. No more overselling items I don't have, no more forgetting to reorder popular sizes. My customers are happier and my stress is way down."

### "Worth every fils"

*Mohammed, Restaurant Owner, Cairo*

> "I tried expensive cloud systems that needed internet and monthly fees. Daftarli works even when internet is down (which is often here!), one-time payment, and it does everything I need. The offline mode is a lifesaver during power outages."
